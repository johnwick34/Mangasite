      <h2>📘 Crimson Campus – Episode 1: The Smile Everyone Loves</h2>
      <p>
       
They call me “I.”
Not because that’s my real name, but because no one really asks.
To most people, I’m just a face — one that’s always smiling, always loud, always energetic. A senior at Tokyo University. The one everyone waves at, the one juniors look up to, the one who never seems to run out of energy.
As I walk through the university gates, the morning sun spilling golden light across the red-brick campus, shouts of “Senpai!” and “Yo, I!” echo around me. I wave back, grinning like an idiot. It’s what they expect. That’s who I’m supposed to be — the happy guy.
But before I head to class, I make a quick detour.
The smoking zone.
It’s always quiet here. No crowd, no expectations.
Just me, a lukewarm cup of tea from the vending machine, and a cigarette between my fingers. I light it, take a slow drag, and let the silence wrap around me like a blanket. The smile fades. My eyes grow tired again. For a few minutes, I can breathe.
Nobody sees this side of me. And that’s exactly the point.
Later, I’m in class — CSE lab, code on the screen. My fingers move quickly over the keyboard. I’m focused, more focused than most of the class. I didn’t sleep last night. I was debugging until 4 a.m.
But no one knows that. No one cares either.
I can feel the professor’s eyes glance past me, not on me. To them, I’m not the serious one. I’m not the genius. I’m just… I.
After class, I find myself back at the smoking zone. The sun’s lower now. My phone screen glows in the dimming light, a message from one of the kids I tutor: “Will you be there today, sensei?”
Of course I will. I always am.
Behind me, I overhear some classmates whispering.
“He’s always joking around.”
“Does he ever take life seriously?”
“But he helps everyone. Like... genuinely.”
“Yeah, but he’s weird. Always smiling.”
They don’t get it.
Smiling isn’t always happiness. Sometimes, it’s just survival.
In the evening, I walk through back alleys to reach a small rented space tucked between shops. My cram school. Not to attend — to teach.
I run it myself. I help students who are struggling — the ones no one has patience for. Some have learning issues, some are just scared of failure. I know that feeling. That fear. I see myself in all of them.
They call me “sensei” here.
It’s the only place where I feel useful.
I don’t ask for money from my parents. Haven’t in years. I make my own way.
And somehow, that’s enough.
Late at night, I sit alone on a bench in an empty park. Streetlights flicker overhead. I light another cigarette and stare up at the sky, searching for something in the stars that probably isn’t there.
In the dark, I don’t have to smile.
And that’s the most peaceful part of my day.

      <h2>📘 Crimson Campus – Episode 2: The Day the Sky Broke</h2>
      <p>
The next morning, I put on my best.
Black tuxedo. White shirt. Sunglasses. Shined shoes.
It’s project presentation day, and I figured — if I’m gonna fail, I’ll fail in style.
I check the mirror before heading out. The reflection grins back at me. Clean. Sharp. Confident. Maybe even dangerous.
For a second, I actually believe it.
On campus, heads turn. Girls giggle. Guys whistle.
Someone says, “He looks brighter than the damn sun!”
I just laugh it off. I take selfies with juniors, high-five friends, charm teachers in the hallway. It’s all part of the performance.
That’s who I am, right?
But deep down, I feel something.
A weird tension in my chest. Like the wind knows something I don’t.
In the auditorium, the crowd is huge. Everyone’s gathered for presentations. Even the professors are relaxed, smiling.
When my name is called, people cheer. Some stand.
I walk to the stage, waving like I’m famous.
This is it. My moment.
I grip the mic.
But then —
Bang.
A gunshot.
Then another.
The cheering stops. Screams fill the hall. Chaos erupts.
I freeze for half a second. Then instinct kicks in.
I drop the mic, jump off the stage, and start shouting.
“OUT! THIS WAY! MOVE!”
I grab students, push open doors, guide them toward exits. Some trip, some cry, some don’t move at all.
I want to save them all. But I know this isn’t just the auditorium.
This is everywhere.
The entire campus is under attack.
My heart’s pounding. My hands are shaking.
My eyes scan the exits, the hallways, the blood on the floor.
And for the first time in years…
I’m not faking it.
I’m truly, terrifyingly scared.

      <h2>📘 Crimson Campus – Episode 3: Smile of the Forgotten Soldier</h2>
      <p>
The screams had quieted.
Now, there was only the sound of boots echoing against the blood-slick marble floor... and the occasional muffled sob of a dying student.
“I” stood frozen, knees trembling, breath short, as if the terror had reached into his chest and clenched his lungs shut.
There were bodies everywhere.
Familiar ones — classmates, juniors, teachers.
Some were already gone.
Some… still breathing, but barely.
His shoes splashed in the blood of people he once shared lunches with. He could still hear their laughter echoing in his mind.
And now... silence.
Just ahead, three figures stood in the hallway — tall, cold, draped in black combat gear. Masks on. Guns loaded. Movements calculated.
Terrorists.
One of them spotted him.
A rifle raised.
The steel muzzle aimed directly at his chest.
“I” couldn’t move.
He was shaking.
His fingers twitched. His mouth was dry. His eyes welled up.
He opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out — just air and panic.
Then, finally, he whispered, voice cracking:
“Please... stop.”
The one in the middle — taller than the rest — let out a cruel laugh. A low, guttural chuckle that echoed through the blood-soaked hallway.
“Stop?”
“Stop killing them… and start killing you instead?”
“That would be more fun, wouldn’t it, boy?”
The other two laughed too. Mocking. Confident. Ready to pull the trigger.
“I” stood still. Head bowed. Trembling.
But then… something shifted.
He slowly raised his head and locked eyes with the leader.
His fear didn’t disappear — it evolved.
It twisted.
His lips curled into something the terrorists hadn’t expected — a smile.
Not the usual cheerful one.
This was something different.
Something broken.
Something dangerous.
The air changed.
“What if…”
“What if I’m not scared?”
“What if I kill you first?”
“What if I take your gun... and kill all three of you?”
His voice had changed — lower, steadier, laced with madness.
The terrorists stopped laughing.
“Wouldn’t that be more fun to watch?” he added, tilting his head slightly.
And then, he laughed — not a laugh of joy, but of something feral.
Something long buried.

💭 Flashback – Age 15
The color fades to grey. The scene flickers.
A younger version of “I” — dressed in camouflage fatigues, standing with a rifle in his hands, eyes sharp and posture perfect.
He was 15 when he joined the voluntary military training program.
Not because he wanted to fight, but because he wanted discipline. Control. A way to silence the chaos in his head.
And he had excelled.
Target shooting. Weapon handling. Tactical movement.
He wasn't just good — he was elite.
They called him "Ghost" for how quietly and precisely he moved.
His room back then had medals stacked on the wall — awards no one at the university even knew about.
No one had ever asked.
<b> Back to Present</b> – Blood and Steel
In the hallway, the air was still.
The terrorist leader's hands, once steady, now shook slightly.
“You… You were bluffing, weren’t you?” he muttered.
“I” took a step forward.
And then another.
His hands weren't shaking anymore.
“Try me.”
The next few seconds were a blur of motion.
And for the first time — they were the ones who looked afraid.

      <h2>📘 Crimson Campus – Episode 4: The Angel of Death</h2>
      <p>
        
The corridor was quiet again, but this time not with peace — with anticipation.
“I” stepped forward slowly, the blood-soaked soles of his shoes sticking faintly with each move. His eyes locked onto the three terrorists still standing — rifles aimed, postures rigid. But their fingers… were trembling.
He bent down and picked up a long splintered piece of wood from the shattered furniture nearby — thick, jagged at the ends. It felt heavy, like a club. He gripped it tight.
“Try me,” he growled.
Without warning, he launched forward. His body twisted mid-air as he went in for a bicycle kick, the sole of his foot slamming into the head of the leader. The man collapsed like a dropped puppet.
Before the other two could react, “I” landed and swung the wood into the second one’s ribs. A crack. A scream. Another turn, and the wood struck the third across the temple.
In less than ten seconds, all three were down.
Not dead — but paralyzed.
Not unconscious — but terrified.
They writhed and gasped, trapped between pain and panic.
“I” didn’t stop to gloat.
He knelt beside the fallen leader, took his rifle, and quickly checked the magazine. Still loaded. He pocketed spare magazines from their vests, tucked them into his jacket, and then — with clinical precision — disassembled every remaining weapon, pulling out bolts, clips, even bending barrels where he could.
He tossed the useless gun parts into separate corners of the hallway, where no one else could reach them.
And then, he stood above the leader’s broken body — eyes blank, jaw set.
Without saying a word, he pointed the pistol at the man’s forehead...
and pulled the trigger.
One shot.
Then another.
Then the last.
Three men lay dead. Not just defeated — executed.
________________________________________
He tucked the pistol into the waistband of his trousers, its grip barely visible under his blazer.
A combat knife, taken from the second terrorist, he slid down into his sock — hidden, but ready.
He slung the rifle across his back, gripped tight, and headed down the bloodied hall.
He wasn’t just surviving anymore.
He was hunting.
________________________________________
Outside, the faint thump of military helicopters echoed from above, circling the smoke-covered campus.
“I” paused at the end of the corridor, looking up through a shattered window.
They were here.
But they weren’t landing.
And he knew why.
Every time the military tried to breach the gates, more students were shot. The terrorists had made it clear: any outside interference meant another body dropped. They had snipers. They had explosives. And now... they had fear.
But he had something else.
No rules. No leash. Nothing to lose.
________________________________________
He climbed a rusted maintenance ladder to the rooftop, his hands scraping against the cold metal. Once up, he waved, jumped, yelled — but the choppers didn’t respond. Maybe they couldn’t see him. Maybe they weren’t allowed to.
Either way, he descended again.
If help wasn’t coming, he would bring help himself.
________________________________________
Inside the north building, he crept through empty hallways littered with glass, backpacks, and blood. Then — voices. Faint, female, muffled.
He followed.
It led to one of the common rooms — a wide lounge where students usually played board games, studied between classes, or napped on the beanbags. Now it was a prison.
He peered through a narrow window slit on the door.
There were at least four terrorists inside, lazily standing around — one holding a gun loosely, another joking about something.
And in the corner, a group of girls were tied up with duct tape — some crying, some too shocked to react.
He counted. Measured. Visualized.
Then, he knocked.
“Who the hell is it?” one of them barked.
“I” replied, voice calm, low, and cold:
“Azakiel… the angel of death.”
He kicked the door open and stepped in.
Before the first man could lift his weapon, the room erupted in gunfire. Controlled bursts. No wasted movement.
Three seconds. Four corpses.
They didn’t even know what hit them.
Silence returned.
The tied-up girls stared at him — wide-eyed, faces pale. Some of them knew him. Had admired him. Maybe even had crushes on him once.
Now, they saw a stranger.
Blood on his hands. A gun slung from his shoulder. Eyes... unreadable.
He didn’t smile. He didn’t comfort them.
“No one leaves this room unless I say so,” he said flatly.
They nodded in unison, too terrified to speak.
He stared for a moment longer, then walked over, grabbed the corpses one by one by the collar, and dragged them outside the room — leaving behind a thick trail of blood.
No one followed.
No one asked where he took them.
No one wanted to know.
