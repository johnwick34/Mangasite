      <h2>📘 Crimson Campus – Episode 1: The Smile Everyone Loves</h2>
      <p>
       
They call me “I.”
Not because that’s my real name, but because no one really asks.
To most people, I’m just a face — one that’s always smiling, always loud, always energetic. A senior at Tokyo University. The one everyone waves at, the one juniors look up to, the one who never seems to run out of energy.
As I walk through the university gates, the morning sun spilling golden light across the red-brick campus, shouts of “Senpai!” and “Yo, I!” echo around me. I wave back, grinning like an idiot. It’s what they expect. That’s who I’m supposed to be — the happy guy.
But before I head to class, I make a quick detour.
The smoking zone.
It’s always quiet here. No crowd, no expectations.
Just me, a lukewarm cup of tea from the vending machine, and a cigarette between my fingers. I light it, take a slow drag, and let the silence wrap around me like a blanket. The smile fades. My eyes grow tired again. For a few minutes, I can breathe.
Nobody sees this side of me. And that’s exactly the point.
Later, I’m in class — CSE lab, code on the screen. My fingers move quickly over the keyboard. I’m focused, more focused than most of the class. I didn’t sleep last night. I was debugging until 4 a.m.
But no one knows that. No one cares either.
I can feel the professor’s eyes glance past me, not on me. To them, I’m not the serious one. I’m not the genius. I’m just… I.
After class, I find myself back at the smoking zone. The sun’s lower now. My phone screen glows in the dimming light, a message from one of the kids I tutor: “Will you be there today, sensei?”
Of course I will. I always am.
Behind me, I overhear some classmates whispering.
“He’s always joking around.”
“Does he ever take life seriously?”
“But he helps everyone. Like... genuinely.”
“Yeah, but he’s weird. Always smiling.”
They don’t get it.
Smiling isn’t always happiness. Sometimes, it’s just survival.
In the evening, I walk through back alleys to reach a small rented space tucked between shops. My cram school. Not to attend — to teach.
I run it myself. I help students who are struggling — the ones no one has patience for. Some have learning issues, some are just scared of failure. I know that feeling. That fear. I see myself in all of them.
They call me “sensei” here.
It’s the only place where I feel useful.
I don’t ask for money from my parents. Haven’t in years. I make my own way.
And somehow, that’s enough.
Late at night, I sit alone on a bench in an empty park. Streetlights flicker overhead. I light another cigarette and stare up at the sky, searching for something in the stars that probably isn’t there.
In the dark, I don’t have to smile.
And that’s the most peaceful part of my day.

      <h2>📘 Crimson Campus – Episode 2: The Day the Sky Broke</h2>
      <p>
The next morning, I put on my best.
Black tuxedo. White shirt. Sunglasses. Shined shoes.
It’s project presentation day, and I figured — if I’m gonna fail, I’ll fail in style.
I check the mirror before heading out. The reflection grins back at me. Clean. Sharp. Confident. Maybe even dangerous.
For a second, I actually believe it.
On campus, heads turn. Girls giggle. Guys whistle.
Someone says, “He looks brighter than the damn sun!”
I just laugh it off. I take selfies with juniors, high-five friends, charm teachers in the hallway. It’s all part of the performance.
That’s who I am, right?
But deep down, I feel something.
A weird tension in my chest. Like the wind knows something I don’t.
In the auditorium, the crowd is huge. Everyone’s gathered for presentations. Even the professors are relaxed, smiling.
When my name is called, people cheer. Some stand.
I walk to the stage, waving like I’m famous.
This is it. My moment.
I grip the mic.
But then —
Bang.
A gunshot.
Then another.
The cheering stops. Screams fill the hall. Chaos erupts.
I freeze for half a second. Then instinct kicks in.
I drop the mic, jump off the stage, and start shouting.
“OUT! THIS WAY! MOVE!”
I grab students, push open doors, guide them toward exits. Some trip, some cry, some don’t move at all.
I want to save them all. But I know this isn’t just the auditorium.
This is everywhere.
The entire campus is under attack.
My heart’s pounding. My hands are shaking.
My eyes scan the exits, the hallways, the blood on the floor.
And for the first time in years…
I’m not faking it.
I’m truly, terrifyingly scared.
